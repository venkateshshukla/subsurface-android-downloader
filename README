Dive Downloader Application for Android as a Proof of Concept
==============================================================

Using libdivecomputer, this application is targeted to download dive related
informations from various divecomputers and give back an XML file containing all
related information.

Things Planned
===============

1. A framework for cross compilation of libdivecomputer and other requisite
library for use on android.
2. JNI Wrappers to use these library functions on android.
3. Android UI for selecting divecomputers, extraction of data and displaying the
list of xml files.

Android UI
==========

The android UI should minimally contain the following things.
1. A list of currently supported divecomputers.
2. A list of attached USB devices for selection.
3. Progress of dive download on selection of divecomputer.
4. List of xml files generated and stored on SD after import from divecomputers.
5. Manipulation of these files such as viewing, renaming, sharing, deleting etc.
